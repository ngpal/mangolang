# 11-09-2025

- [x] symantic analysis
  - How do we know if p in `*p = a` is a valid derefence?
    - parser guarantees its a deref in the first place (parse_reassign is only triggered with ident or *)
    - type checker guarantees deref is valid, and only valid derefs are of ref types, and only valid ref types are identifiers (also guaranteed by the parser and type checker)

- [x] grammar
- [x] isa
- [x] codegen
- [x] vm
  - [x] allow access to stack and frame pointers through registers r4 and r5

- [x] add slices to all the errors ever

- [x] writing output (hacky)

- [x] refactor linker

# 14-09-2025

- [x] split compiler into compiler, assembler and linker
- [x] enable vm to check for magic number in binary
- [x] rewrite hardcoded print subroutine in assembly

# 15-09-2025

- [x] functions
  - [x] func def
    - [x] parsing

    - [x] semantincs

# 16-09-2025

  - [x] parsing
  - [x] type checking
  - [x] symantics
- [x] instructions for memory access wrt pointer registers
- [x] get rid of the whole slots situation actually, use stack pointer offsets

## Major deprication in the ISA

    - LOAD8 and STORE8 will no longer be used

## New conundrum

    - what if the stack is dirty when calling ret?
    - return values, where do they go?

## The answer?

    - Calling convention!

- [x] codegen

# 18-09-2025

- [x] give main function special thingies like
  - [x] no params
  - [x] no return
  - [x] no RET, straight to HALT
- [x] assembler
- [x] linker?
- [x] implement new ops on vm
- [x] require main function

# 19-09-2025

- [x] fix bug in typechecker that ignores returns nested inside other structures
  - took out hunting for a return statement in the function. that wont be good long term

# 20-09-2025

- [[what-do-the-semantic-passes-handle-currently|check for notes on the type checker]]

## Plan of action

- [x] renames slices to span
- [x] modify AST to handle slices properly and accurately

# 21-09-2025

- [x] handle return type problem (does not even check for returns in a function now)

### The `RetStatus` Situation

- Allow `Maybe`s when type checking, throw errors at it in the analyzer run

- [x] modify AST to carry types, set by type checker
- [x] `analyzer.rs` should handle main function checking, breaks/continues, reference validation
- [x] seperating if statements and if expressions (relevant for type and return checking)

- [x] fix loop print 1-10 code bug
- [x] calling convention fix in `type_check.rs` `declare_function`

## Calling convention

Stack grows down (top of stack is higher memory)

```
+---------------------------+
|       Optional return     | <- only if function returns non-unit
+---------------------------+
|        Parameter n        |
+---------------------------+
|        Parameter ...      |
+---------------------------+
|        Parameter 1        |
+---------------------------+
|       Return address      | <- (fp + 4) callerâ€™s return location
+---------------------------+
|           Old FP          | <- (fp + 2) previous FP
+---------------------------+
|      Local variables      | <- (fp + 0) allocated downward from fp_offset
+---------------------------+
|           ...             | <- lower memory
```

# 22-09-2025

- [x] fix branching and pushing 0 or 1 mess
  - [x] send the condition into a seperate function -> if condition is not binaryop, evalute with gen_instrs and return -> if its a binary op, gen left and right recursively -> if its ||/&&, handle accordingly -> if its comparison, handle accordingly, plug in the correct branch instrs
- [x] found another bug, when a function is called, locals arent allocated, which makes `sp` dip down into the locals in some cases
- [x] debugger TUI overhaul

# 23-09-2025

- [x] char datatype
  - [x] lexer/parser
  - [x] single byte
    - [x] allow comparisons
    - [x] no arithmetic operations allowed on it
  - [x] allow convertions to and from char to int
    - [x] `as` keyword implementation

    ### Conversion Rules
    - `int as char` int & 0xF
    - `bool as int` reinterpret
    - `char as int` reinterpret

  - [x] change functionality of disp to print one `char` w/o newline
  - [x] rewrite a `print` subroutine (move away from using `PRINT` and `MVCUR`, they're pretty high level for assembly instructions and I wanna move away from them)
- [x] Hello, world!
- [x] mod instruction
- [x] hex numbers in assembly

## NOTE

- Can't reliably print numbers because no data structure to store and reverse the order of the digits haha

- [x] constants in assembly
- [x] rewrite print subroutine with the constants
- [ ] stack allocated arrays
  - [x] lexer
  - [x] ast
    - [x] indexing
  - [x] parser
    - [x] allow shorthand `var a[b: type]` where `b` has to be an int literal. ??? type?
    - [x] allow `var a = [1, 2, 3, 4];`
    - [x] indexing
    - [x] type definitions
    - [x] disallow empty arrays
  - [x] type checker
    - [x] type checking for new ast nodes
    - [x] handle type definitions
    - [x] handle assigning to an index

## ASSUMPTION

> Each statements leaves the sp where it found it (ideally)

- When this assumption fails, the stack allocated arrays fall. And it could fail, ALL THE TIME.
- Should I enforce it?
  - I will proceed assuming it leaves it untouched and see if there are any serious offenders
  - Dead code analysis could fix all of this, but I digress
  - Look into stack balancing

  - [x] codegen
    - [x] generate code for new ast kinds
    - [x] `var a[4]`, evaluating `a` in `var x = a`, `x` would get a pointer to the array;

## HUGE BUG

- The way `TypedAstNode::from_ast` works, everything gets an eval type of Unit passed down to it from statements getting unit.

# 25-09-2025

- [x] each element in a `char` or `bool` array may only take up 1 byte + padding
  - [x] new instructions `LOADPB` and `STOREPB` for byte addressing
  - Whats the strategy?
    - Allocate the stack first
    - Compute each element
    - Pack it in

- [x] allow size ambigious array type definitions in function parameters
  - [x] must be mandatory for vardef, but not in function parameter context
- [x] introduced a tiny optimization for labels and jumps
- [x] strings!
  - [x] null terminated
  - [x] lexer
  - [x] parser
  - [x] typechecker - pass as `[char]`
  - [x] analyzer
  - [x] codegen

- [x] store strings in data section of binary
  - [x] introduce sections into the assembly format
    - [x] `@section data` and `@section text` in the assembly
    - [x] data section needs to only handle strings for now.

## Assembly file structure

```
; constants
@define X = 42
@define Y = 0x2E

; data section allow labelled and unlabelled data
@section data
msg = "Hello, world!\n"

; text section
@section text

start:
  CALL main
  HALT
main:
  PUSH16 msg
  POPR   r0
  CALL   print
  RET
```

- [x] new pseudo-instruction `DATA`
- [x] update linker
- [x] update binary format
- [x] update vm

# 26-09-2025

- [x] update compiler
  - [x] write `@section text` above the instructions
  - [x] generate arrays in reverse so that the indeces goes up
  - [x] use data section for strings

## Immediate plans for VM

### VM v0.1.1

# 07-10-2025

- [x] reduce/simplify instruction set
  - [x] warnings in the VM for depricated instructions
  - [x] convenience instructions (or macros/subroutines) are expanded out in the assembler
  - [x] remove depricated instructions from the compiler
  - [x] implement mul, div and mod subroutines
    - [x] expand to 8 GPRs, just makes life easier writing subroutines
      - r0-r5 caller-saved (volatile)
      - r6-r7 callee-saved (preserved)
      - r8 sp
      - r9 fp

# 08-10-2025

### Sidequest ALERT

- [x] Interrupt/like command to put a character on the screen
  - [x] Tear out video memory from the VM
  - [x] Implement it as a seperate array in the debug screen
  - This is relevant because it DRASTICALLY reduces the code size for debugging purposes
  - Kinda magic-y atm

# 09-10-2025

- [x] fix the horrible bug, i suspect something is getting messed up in the indexing logic
  - it was failure to clear r0 in the beginning of the mul subroutine
- [x] new bug because of ordering of value and addr in `STW` cant match with `STR`
  - [x] rearrange ordering

# 10-10-2025

- proper interrupts
  - [x] emulate a disk with 65,536 (2 bytes) sectors, each sector 256 bytes. total 16 MB of storage
    - [x] decide a file format for the disk for efficient data storage, we dont want to bloat up the RAM on the host device when loading the disk
      - there will be a folder called `disk`
        - there will be a `table.bin` file that keeps track of which sectors and occupied and which are empty
        - empty sectors have no corresponding files, occupied sectors have a corresponding file called `sector_XXXX.bin`, `XXXX` being the sector address in hex.
  - [x] update linker with option to modify base offset
    - [x] kernel mode and user mode
      - [x] switch to kernel mode when calling `INT`
      - [x] `IRET` switches back to user mode
      - [x] user mode only allows writing to stack (and allocated parts of heap but we dont have a heap right now)
      - [x] kernel mode can modify anywhere, except rom, nothing can write to rom

# 11-10-2025

- [x] first sector contains BIOS, its loaded by the host from the ROM
- [x] the BIOS then gets executed, which saves the IVT, and loads the Interrupt handlers into memory
  - [x] lets define 8 interrupts for now
    - [x] 0 - print char
    - [x] 2 - send command to disk
    - [x] rest can `IRET` straight back
  - [x] MMIO definitions for disk and terminal
  - [x] enterrupt handlers can live in sectors 1-8 and will be loaded in by the BIOS
  - [x] user code can live in sector 9-72 (16KB) (64 sectors)
- [x] split shift instructions to `SHL` and `SHR`
- [ ] imul and idiv subroutines are horribly inefficient. fix that

## Plans for the vm

> Not touching this anytime soon. VM is simple enough now, might get rid of a few instructions but let it stay a stack machine

- Focus on flushing out all the bugs in the codegen, and then focus on vm
  - [ ] redesign the ISA, a lot of bloat instructions that can be avoided
  - [ ] move away from purely stack based design into more register/stack design
  - [ ] ideally take inspiration from or entirely emulate an alreay existing CPU of similar power
  - [ ] Seperate the VM project from the rest of the compiler
  - [ ] Macros in the assembly? (inspiriation from the jdh video)
