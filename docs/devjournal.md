- [x] registers
  - [x] design changes to instruction set to include registers

- [x] modulo operator

- [x] pointers
  - @a to get pointer *a to deref
  - 16 bit, obviously

# 11-09-2025
  - [x] symantic analysis
    - How do we know if p in `*p = a` is a valid derefence?
      - parser guarantees its a deref in the first place (parse_reassign is only triggered with ident or *)
      - type checker guarantees deref is valid, and only valid derefs are of ref types, and only valid ref types are identifiers (also guaranteed by the parser and type checker)

  - [x] grammar
  - [x] isa
  - [x] codegen
  - [x] vm
    - [x] allow access to stack and frame pointers through registers r4 and r5

- [x] add slices to all the errors ever

- [x] writing output (hacky)
  - I'm going to use a disp keyword followed by an expression which will write that information ("magically" converts ints and bools) into video memory
  - new instructions
    - PRINT - pops from the stack and writes the lower 8 bits to the video memory at cursor
    - MVCUR i8 - move the cursor relative to current position

- [x] refactor linker

# 14-09-2025
- [x] split compiler into compiler, assembler and linker
- [x] enable vm to check for magic number in binary
- [x] rewrite hardcoded print subroutine in assembly

# 15-09-2025
- [x] functions
  - [x] func def
    - [x] parsing
    - [x] type checking - disallow redefs

# 16-09-2025

    - [x] type checking
    - [x] symantics
  - [x] instructions for memory access wrt pointer registers
  - [x] get rid of the whole slots situation actually, use stack pointer offsets

  ## Major deprication in the ISA
    - LOAD8 and STORE8 will no longer be used

  ## New conundrum
    - what if the stack is dirty when calling ret?
    - return values, where do they go?

  ## The answer?
    - Calling convention!

  - [x] codegen

# 18-09-2025
  - [x] give main function special thingies like
    - [x] no params
    - [x] no return
    - [x] no RET, straight to HALT
  - [x] assembler
  - [x] linker?
  - [x] implement new ops on vm
  - [x] require main function

# 19-09-2025
- [x] fix bug in typechecker that ignores returns nested inside other structures
  - took out hunting for a return statement in the function. that wont be good long term

# 20-09-2025
- [[what-do-the-semantic-passes-handle-currently|check for notes on the type checker]]

## Plan of action
- [x] renames slices to span
- [x] modify AST to handle slices properly and accurately

# 21-09-2025
- [x] handle return type problem (does not even check for returns in a function now)

### The `RetStatus` Situation
  - Allow `Maybe`s when type checking, throw errors at it in the analyzer run

  - [x] modify AST to carry types, set by type checker
  - [x] `analyzer.rs` should handle main function checking, breaks/continues, reference validation
- [x] seperating if statements and if expressions (relevant for type and return checking)

- [x] fix loop print 1-10 code bug
- [x] calling convention fix in `type_check.rs` `declare_function`

## Calling convention
Stack grows down (top of stack is higher memory)

```
+---------------------------+
|       Optional return     | <- only if function returns non-unit
+---------------------------+
|        Parameter n        |
+---------------------------+
|        Parameter ...      |
+---------------------------+
|        Parameter 1        |
+---------------------------+
|       Return address      | <- (fp + 4) callerâ€™s return location
+---------------------------+
|           Old FP          | <- (fp + 2) previous FP
+---------------------------+
|      Local variables      | <- (fp + 0) allocated downward from fp_offset
+---------------------------+
|           ...             | <- lower memory
```

# 22-09-2025
- [x] fix branching and pushing 0 or 1 mess
  - [x] send the condition into a seperate function -> if condition is not binaryop, evalute with gen_instrs and return -> if its a binary op, gen left and right recursively -> if its ||/&&, handle accordingly -> if its comparison, handle accordingly, plug in the correct branch instrs
- [x] found another bug, when a function is called, locals arent allocated, which makes `sp` dip down into the locals in some cases
- [x] debugger TUI overhaul

# 23-09-2025
- [x] char datatype
  - [x] lexer/parser
  - [x] single byte
    - [x] allow comparisons
    - [x] no arithmetic operations allowed on it
  - [x] allow convertions to and from char to int
    - [x] `as` keyword implementation

    ### Conversion Rules
    - `int as char` int & 0xF
    - `bool as int` reinterpret
    - `char as int` reinterpret
    
  - [x] change functionality of disp to print one `char` w/o newline
  - [x] rewrite a `print` subroutine (move away from using `PRINT` and `MVCUR`, they're pretty high level for assembly instructions and I wanna move away from them)
- [x] Hello, world!
- [x] mod instruction
- [x] hex numbers in assembly

## NOTE
- Can't reliably print numbers because no data structure to store and reverse the order of the digits haha

- [x] constants in assembly
- [x] rewrite print subroutine with the constants
- [ ] stack allocated arrays
  - [x] lexer
  - [x] ast
    - [x] indexing
  - [x] parser
    - [x] allow shorthand `var a[b: type]` where `b` has to be an int literal. ??? type?
    - [x] allow `var a = [1, 2, 3, 4];`
    - [x] indexing
    - [x] type definitions
    - [x] disallow empty arrays
  - [x] type checker
    - [x] type checking for new ast nodes
    - [x] handle type definitions
    - [x] handle assigning to an index

## ASSUMPTION
> Each statements leaves the sp where it found it (ideally)

- When this assumption fails, the stack allocated arrays fall. And it could fail, ALL THE TIME.
- Should I enforce it?
  - I will proceed assuming it leaves it untouched and see if there are any serious offenders
  - Dead code analysis could fix all of this, but I digress
  - Look into stack balancing

  - [x] codegen
    - [x] generate code for new ast kinds
    - [x] `var a[4]`, evaluating `a` in `var x = a`, `x` would get a pointer to the array;

## HUGE BUG
- The way `TypedAstNode::from_ast` works, everything gets an eval type of Unit passed down to it from statements getting unit.
  
# 25-09-2025
- [x] each element in a `char` or `bool` array may only take up 1 byte + padding
  - [x] new instructions `LOADPB` and `STOREPB` for byte addressing
  - Whats the strategy?
    - Allocate the stack first
    - Compute each element
    - Pack it in

- [x] allow size ambigious array type definitions in function parameters
  - [x] must be mandatory for vardef, but not in function parameter context
- [x] introduced a tiny optimization for labels and jumps
- [x] strings!
  - [x] null terminated
  - [x] lexer
  - [x] parser
  - [x] typechecker - pass as `[char]`
  - [x] analyzer
  - [x] codegen

- [ ] store strings in data section of binary
  - [x] introduce sections into the assembly format
    - [x] `@section data` and `@section text` in the assembly
    - [x] data section needs to only handle strings for now.

## Assembly file structure
```
; constants
@define X = 42
@define Y = 0x2E

; data section allow labelled and unlabelled data
@section data
msg = "Hello, world!\n"

; text section
@section text

start:
  CALL main
  HALT
main:
  PUSH16 msg
  POPR   r0
  CALL   print
  RET
```

  - [x] new pseudo-instruction `DATA`
  - [x] update linker
  - [x] update binary format
  - [x] update vm

# 26-09-2025
  - [ ] update compiler
    - [x] write `@section text` above the instructions
    - [ ] use data section for strings
- [ ] allow multiple files
  - [ ] enforce main function on a assembler level not compiler level
  - [ ] allow only function headers to pass through for functions implemented in assembly
    - [ ] new syntax for letting a function pass through the undefined functions check
  - [ ] new syntax for imports

- [ ] stack balancing
  - [ ] assigning to `_` discards the value
  - [ ] statements that have `eval_type != Unit` can be considered the same as `var _ = stmt;`
- [ ] inctroduce += syntax
- [ ] introduce `uint` type
- [ ] allow only `uint`s to index
- [ ] send all errors together instead of bubbling up
- [ ] heap allocation!
  - [ ] simple bump allocator
- [ ] vectors!
- [ ] floats?

## Plans for the vm
- Focus on flushing out all the bugs in the codegen, and then focus on vm
  - [ ] redesign the ISA, a lot of bloat instructions that can be avoided
  - [ ] move away from purely stack based design into more register/stack design
  - [ ] ideally take inspiration from or entirely emulate an alreay existing CPU of similar power
  - [ ] Seperate the VM project from the rest of the compiler
  - [ ] Macros in the assembly? (inspiriation from the jdh video)

- [ ] implement an IR for base level optimizations
  - [ ] implement IR
  - [ ] constant folding
  - [ ] dead code analysis
- [ ] constants
- [ ] functions as parameters
- [ ] register based arithmetic instructions
